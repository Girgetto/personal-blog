This is a list of 5 extensions and themes for VS Code that I often use and find useful.

1. [**ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets) ✂️

This extension gives use a great number of code snippets to create components or imports faster. The first I do after create a new React component file is to use this extension, which autocomplete the initial part of a new component by just typing `rafc + enter` 🤯

👉 [Here the list of snippets](https://github.com/dsznajder/vscode-es7-javascript-react-snippets#basic-methods)

2. [**Code Spell Checker**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) 🇬🇧

This is a _grammar checker for VS Code_, I lost the count of how many times this extension saved me from typos. When you misspell an English word as variable or string, the extension will print a blue underline, and you can fix it with right click and see if in the suggested words there is the one needed

3. [**vscode-styled-components**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jpoissonnier.vscode-styled-components) 🌈

I use a lot styled-component and thanks to this extension CSS remains colored has normal otherwise it will be considered as a string, and it would be just green text

4. [**CodeSandbox Theme**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ngryman.codesandbox-theme) 🎨

I often code in CodeSandbox, and then I use that code in my project, I prefer to maintain a theme consistence, that's why I use it

5. [**Git Graph**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph) 🌳

Git Graph gives you a really nice view of your branches
also, can perform Git Actions, View commit details and file changes, compare any two commits by clicking on a commit, Code Review, etc...
