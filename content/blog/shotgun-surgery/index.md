Shotgun Surgery refers to when a single change is made to multiple classes simultaneously. 

>How can I recognize it?

When you are changing different parts of your code for just one functionality that could by a __shotgun surgery__.

We are going to make an example with javascript functional programming 
```js
const bankAccount = {
  amount: 10
};

const transfer = (toSend) => {
  if (bankAccount.amount <= 0) {
    console.log("Mininum balance shuold be over 0");
  }

  bankAccount.amount -= toSend;
  console.log(`Your balance is ${bankAccount.amount} €`);
};

const checkYourBalance = () => {
  if (bankAccount.amount <= 0) {
    console.log("amount should be over 0");
  }

  console.log(`Your balance is ${bankAccount.amount} €`);
};
```

In this example if we need to change the condition we will need to modified the code twice, we can avoid it by insert the condition in a function.

```js
const isUnderBudget = () => bankAccount.amount <= 0;s
```

There is another part of the code that could be move to only one method

```js
console.log(`Your balance is ${bankAccount.amount} €`);
```

This function could be a function property of the object bankAccount and obtain this code

```js
const bankAccount = {
  amount: 10,
  getBalance: () => console.log(`Your balance is ${bankAccount.amount} $`)
}

const isUnderBudget = () => bankAccount.amount <= 0;

const transfer = (toSend) => {
  if(isUnderBudget()) {
    console.log("Minimum balance should be over 0");
  }

  bankAccount.amount -=toSend;
  bankAccount.getBalance();
}


const checkYourBalance = () => {
  if(isUnderBudget()) {
    console.log("amount should be over 0");
  }
  bankAccount.getBalance();
}
```

Now if we need to make a simple change in one method we only do once,

_Warning_: this refactor is not always the best solution, because it could create a [Divergent change](https://refactoring.guru/smells/divergent-change)
