### Reflections

I've participated in the 2019 and 2020 Hacktoberfest and I found a great difference between this two years. **This year there were a great increment of people** who has partecipated in the hacktoberfest and contributed to the open source.

**I found this increment a good and a bad at the same time.** Why?

Because on the one side of the hand there have been a lot of help from those who wanted to, in order to improve projects who need help by the community. On the other hand **we have sawed lots of PRs there were useless and has caused noise in the repository** and made the work of maintainers harder than usual.

The great thing that we saw is the rapid response from the Hacktoberfest organizer and from the platforms like Github, with rapid response and solutions to [limit interactions for a period of time](https://twitter.com/github/status/1311772722234560517), to slow down the noise.

###Conclusion

I've really enjoyed participating in the Hacktoberfest of this year. For me it's a great initiative to let people approach the open source and to let it grow. ðŸŒ±
